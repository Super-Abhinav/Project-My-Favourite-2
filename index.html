        <p> My hobby is to play cricket. When i was 4 years old then i started playing Cricket. I get refreshed after playing it. I feel energetic after playing it. It also gives me chance to socialise with my friends. I work with full concentration after playing it. I am a good Batsman. My favourite Player is M.S Dhoni. I have learned all the techniques and tricks of batting just by seeing him playing matches for India in T20 or Test Match. Whenever i get time, i go outside to play cricket with my friends. While playing it, we have lots of fun together. On Saturday and Sunday, i spend atleast 2-3 hours playing it. I have purchased a Cricket Kit also to improve my batting. And with god's grace, i have been selected in my school team. In inter-school competition, I played brilliantly and gained victory for my school. My teachers and parents became very happy.</p>
